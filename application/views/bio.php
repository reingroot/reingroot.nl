		<h2>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
			by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny.</h2>
		<h3>Passion</h3>
		<p>My biggest passion lies with interactive web solutions that are driven by users and a business model; like web shops, applications and communities.</p>

		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>My goal is to create web solutions that:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>have a very positive, efficient and engaging User Experience</li>
			<li>bring a high return on investment for you as a client</li>
			<li>constructively contribute to the evolution of the web</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Study</h3>
		<p>I have always been interested in new technologies and human interaction. Beginning with my study in Multimedia Design (1998-2002) I have build a strong base in hand crafted, accessible (or in Dutch) web interface development (HTML, CSS, JS/AJAX).
		My study in Interaction Design (2002-2006), combined with my strong knowledge of business models, has significantly complemented my practical development skills with the ability of creating web interfaces from a user centered as well as a commercial perspective.</p>
