		<strong>From fourteen years of industry experience, I believe in establishing personal relationships with the new teams I work with and in. </strong>
		My know-how encompasses both business and technical roles, giving me a unique perspective.
		In technical projects, there is a tendency for miscommunications to arise due to the highly specialized nature of different expertises.
		As a project lead and team member I help clients translate technical terminology and processes into clear and understandable terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		My personal motto is that understanding and communicating
		with others is always more productive when we take time to get to know each other.
